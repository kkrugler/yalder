 A year  or yeir  (frae Auld Inglis   gēar   ; Gothic   jēr   ; Runic   jēran   ) is a unit  o time  based on the orbital period  o the Yird  movin aroond the Sun  . Fur an observer at is oan the Yird, thes corresponds tae the period it taes the sun tae complete a bodie coorse throoghit the Zodiac  alang the ecliptic  . In astronomy  , the Julian year  is a unit o time at is defined as 365.25 days  o 86 400    SI seconds  each (nae lowp seconds   ). Internaitional Astronomical Union  " SI units  " accessed Februar 18, 2010. (see table fife an section fife.15.) reprintit frae George A. Wilkins   & IAU commission fife, "The IAU Style Manual (1989)"  (PDF file) in IAU Transactions   vol. xxb Thaur is nae universally acceptit symbol fur the year as a unit o time. The Internaitional Seestem o Units  disnae propose a bodie. A common abbreviation in internaitional uisage is a  (fur the Laitin  wird annus   ), in Scots  an Inglis  an aw y  or yr  . Due tae the Yird's axial kelter  , the coorse o a year sees the passin o the saisons  , marked bi varioos changes in weaither  , hoors o daylicht  , an consequently vegetation  an fertility  . In temperate  an subpolar  regions, generally fower saisons  ur recognized: ware   , simmer   , hairst   an winter   , each wi different temperatur  an wather  , astronomically marked bi the sun reachin the points o equinox  an solstice  —althoogh the climatic saisons lag  behind thair astronomical markers. In some tropical  an subtropical  regions it is mair common tae spick o the rainy  (ur dreich, or monsuin  ) saison versus the dry saison  . A calendar year  is an approximation o the Yird's orbital period in a gien calendar  . A calendar year in the Gregorian calendar  (as weel as in the Julian calendar  ) haes either 365 ( common years  ), or 366 ( lowp years  ) days. The wird "year" is an aw uised o periods loosely associatit but nae strictly identical wi either the astronomical or the calendar year, sic as the saisonal year  , the fiscal year  or the academic year  , etc. Bi extension, the term year  can pure techt the orbital period o onie planit  : fur example, a "Maurtian year" is the time in which Maurs  completes its ain orbit. The term is an aw applied mair broadly tae onie lang period or cycle, sic as the " great year  ". oed  , s.v. "year", entry tae.b.: " transf.  Applied tae a huir uv a lang period or cycle (in chronology  an mythology  , an vaguely in poetic  uise)." 
The year is aft divided intae twal consecutive periods o time cried months  : Januar  , Februar  , Mairch  , Apryle  , Mey  , Juin  , Julie  , Augist  , September  , October  , November  , an Dizember  .

Laitin annus   (a 2nd declension  masculine noon  ); annum  is the accusatife singular  ; anni  is genitife   singular  an nominatife   plural  ; anno  is the datife an ablatife singular) is frae a pie  noin *at-no-   , which yielded Gothic   aþnam  ("year") an aw. Baith *yē-ro-  an *at-no-  ur based oan verbal ruits fur expressin movement— *at-  an *ey-  , respectively—baith meanin "tae go" fur ordinar. The Greek wird fur "year", ἔτος  , is cognate wi Laitin vetus  ("old"), frae peh *wetus-  ("year"), an aw preserved in thes meanin in sanskrit   vat-sa-   ("yearlin calf") an vat-sa-ras   ("year"). Derived frae the Laitin annus  ur a nummer o Scots wirds, sic as annual  , annuity  , anniversary  , etc.; per annum   means "each year". 
A saisonal year  is the time atween successife recurrences o a saisonal  event, sic as the floodin  o a river, the migration  o a species  o spyug  , the flouerin  o a species o plaunt  , the first frost  o the year, or the first scheduled gam o a certain sport  . Aw these events can hae wide variations o mair than a month  frae year tae year. 
A calendar year  is the time atween tois dates wi the sam nam in a calendar  . A half-year (ain half o a year) main rin frae Januar tae Juin  , or Julie  tae Dizember  . No astronomical year haes an integer   nummer  o days or lunar months, sae onie calendar at follows an astronomical year main hae a system o intercalation  sic as lowp years  . Financial an scientific calculations aft uise a 365-day calendar tae simplify daily rates. In the Julian calendar  , the average length o a year is 365.25 days. In a non-lowp year, thaur ur 365 days; in a lowp year  , thaur ur 366 days. A lowp year occurs aboot every fower years. The Gregorian calendar  attempts tae keep the northward equinox  oan or shortly afair Mairch 21, hence it follows the northward equinox year  . The pure techt length o the year is 365.2425  days (as 97 it o 400 years or lowp years); thes is within a bodie ppm  o the current length o the pure techt tropical year  ( 365.242 19   days). It is estimatit at bi the year 4000, the northward equinox will faa back bi a bodie day in the Gregorian calendar, nae coz o thes difference, but coz o the slowin doon o the Yird's rotation an the associatit lengthenin o the Sidereal day  . The Revised Julian calendar  , as uised in some Eastern Orthodox churches  , an aw tries tae synchronize wi the tropical year. The average length o thes calendar's year is 365.242 222   days (as 218 it o 900 years or lowp years). Gregorian an revised Julian calendars will start tae differ in 2800. The persian calendar  , in uise in Afghanistan  an Iran  , haes its year begin oan the day o the northward equinox as determined bi astronomical computation (fur the time zain o tehran  ), as opposed tae uisin an algorithmic system o lowp years. 
A calendar era  is uised tae assign a nummer  tae each individual year, uisin a reference point in the pest as the beginnin o the era. In mony coontries, the maist common era is frae the tradeetional (thoogh noo believed incorrect) year o the birth o Jesus  . Dates in thes era ur designatit as anno domini   (Laitin fur "in the year o the Lord"), abbreviatit AD (fur Anno Domini  ) or CE (fur " common era  "). The year afair yin AD or CE is designatit yin " befair Christ  " (BC) or "befair the common era" (BCE); the year afair at tae BC; etc. Hence thaur wisnae year 0  AD/CE. When the computations involvin years ur dain involvin baith years AD an years BC, it is common tae uise astronomical year nummerin  , in which yin BC is designatit "0", tae BC is designatit "−1", an sae oan. Ither eras ur an aw uised tae enumerate the years in different cultural, religioos, an scientific contexts. 
A fiscal year  or financial year is a 12-month period uised fur calculatin annual financial statements in businesses an ither organizations. In mony jurisdictions, regulations regardin accoontin require sic reports ance per twal months, but dinnae require at the twal months constitute a calendar year. Fur example, in Canada  an Indie  the fiscal year runs frae Apryle  1; in the Unitit Kinrick  it runs frae Apryle yin fur purposes o corporation tax an government financial statements, but frae Apryle sex fur purposes o personal taxation an payment o state benefits; in Australia  it runs frae Julie 1, while in the Unitit States  , the fiscal year o the federal government  runs frae October  yin. 
An academic year is the annual period durin which a student attends an eddicational   institution  . The academic year main be divided intae academic terms  , sic as semesters an quarters. Some schuils  in the UK an USA divide the academic year intae three  rooghly equal-length terms (called "trimesters" or "quarters" in the US), rooghly coincidin wi hairst, winter, an ware. At some, a shortened simmer  session, sometimes considered a pairt o the regular academic year, is attended bi students oan a voluntary or electife basis. Ither schuils break the year intae twa  main semesters, a first (typically Augist  ben Dizember) an a second semester (Januar ben Mey  ). Each o these main semesters main be split in half bi mid-term examinaitions, an each o the halves is referred tae as a " quarter  " (or "term" in some coontries). Thaur main an aw be an electife simmer session and/ur a cuttie Januar session. Some ither schuils, includin some in the Unitit States, hae foor  eddicational periods o markin. The skale year in mony coontries starts in Augist or September  an ends in Mey, Juin, or Julie. Some schuils in the Unitit States, notably Boston Laitin Schuil  , main divide the year intae fife or mair  markin periods. Some state in defense o thes at thaur is aiblins a positife correlation  atween report frequency an academic achievement. Thaur ur typically 180 days o teachin each year in schuils in the usa, excludin weekends an breaks, while 190 days fur pupils in state schuils in the Unititd Kinrick, New Zealain  an Canada an aw. Tho, in Indie  , the academic year normally starts frae Juin yin an ends oan Mey 31. Thocht schuils start closin in the end o ware  , the actual academic closure is oan Mey 31, an in Nepal  it starts frae Julie 15. [ citation needit    ]  schuils an universities in australia typically hae academic years at rooghly align wi the calendar year (i.e. startin in Februar  or Mairch  an endin in October tae Dizember), as the soothern hemisphaur  experiences simmer frae Dizember tae Februar. In Israel  , the academic year begins aroond October or November  , aligned wi the second month o the Hebrew calendar  . 
Main article: Julian year (astronomy)  
The Julian year  , as uised in astronomy  an ither sciences, is a unit o time defined as exactly 365.25 days. Thes is the normal meanin o the unit "year" (symbol "a" frae the Laitin   annus  ) uised in varioos scientific contexts. The Julian century o 36 525   days an the Julian millennium o 365 250   days ur uised in astronomical calculations. Fundamentally, expressin a time interval in Julian years is a way tae precisely specify hoo mony days (nae hoo mony "real" years), fur lang time intervals whaur statin the nummer o days woods be unwieldy an unintuitife. Bi convention, the Julian year is uised in the computation o the distance covered bi a lichtyear  . In the unified code fur units o measure  , the symbol a  (withit subscript  ) aye refers tae the Julian year aj  o exactly 31 557  600    seconds  . 365.25 days o 86 400   seconds = yin a = yin aj = 31.557 6   ms the SI multiplier prefixes main be applied tae it tae f'rm ka  (kiloannum), ma  (megaannum) etc. 
Each o these three years can be luisely cried an "astronomical year". The sidereal year  is the time taen fur the Yird tae complete a bodie revolution o its orbit  , as measured against a fixed fram o reference (sic as the fixed stars, Laitin sidera  , singular sidus  ). Its average duration is 365.256 363  004   pure techt solar days (365 d sex h 9 min 9.76 s) (at the epoch j2000.0  = Januar yin, 2000, 12:00:00 tt  ). International Yird rotation and reference system service. (2010). iers eop pc uiseful constants.  the tropical year  is the period o time fur the ecliptic longitude  o the sun tae increase bi 360 degrees. Syne the sun's ecliptic longitude is measured wi respect tae the equinox, the tropical year comprises a complete cycle o the saisons; coz o the biological an socio-economic importance o the saisons, the tropical year is the basis o maist calendars  . The tropical year is commonly defined [1]   fur the pure techt motion o the sun alang the ecliptic. Thes differs frae the actual time atween passages o, e.g., the northward equinox  fur several reasons explained ablo. Coz o the Yird's axial precession  , thes year is abit 20 minutes  shorter than the Sidereal year. The pure techt tropical year is approximately 365 days, fife hoors, 48 minutes, 45 seconds [2]   (= 365.242 19   days). The anomalistic year is the time taen fur the Yird tae complete a bodie revolution wi respect tae its apsides  . The orbit o the Yird is elliptical  ; the extreme points, cried " apsides  ", or the perihelion  —whaur the Yird is closest tae the sun (aboot 3 Januar in 2011)—an the aphelion  , whaur the Yird is farthest frae the sun (Julie fuir in 2011). The anomalistic year is usually defined as the time atween perihelion passages. Its average duration is 365.259 636   days (365 d sex h 13 min 52.6 s) (at the epoch j2011.0). [3]   if Yird moved in an ideal kepler orbit  , i.e.  a perfect ellipse wi the sun fixed at a bodie focus, each kin o year woods aye hae the sam duration, an the sidereal an anomalistic years woods be equal. Coz o perturbations  bi the gravity  o ither planits, Yird's motion varies slichtly, causin the sidereal an tropical years tae vary in length bi abit 25 minutes (see the table ablo). Baith ur affectit in the sam way, sae at the sidereal year is consistently 20 minutes longer than the tropical year, provided at thay ur measured in huir uv a sam way.

The draconic year, draconitic year, eclipse year, or ecliptic year is the time taen fur the sun (as seen frae the Yird) tae complete a bodie revolution wi respect tae the sam lunar node  (a point whaur the muin  's orbit intersects the ecliptic  ). Thes period is associatit wi eclipses  : these occur only when baith the sun an the muin ur near these nodes; sae eclipses occur within abit a month o every half o an eclipse year. Hence, thaur ur tois eclipse saisons  every eclipse year. The average duration o the eclipse year is: 346.620 075  883   days (346 d 14 h 52 min 54 s) (at the epoch j2000.0). This term is sometimes erroneoosly uised fur the draconic or nodal period o lunar precession  ; at is, the period o a complete revolution o the muin's ascendin node aroond the ecliptic: 18.612 815  932   Julian years ( 6 798.331  019   days, at the epoch j2000.0). 
The full muin cycle  is the time fur the sun (as seen frae the Yird) tae complete a bodie revolution wi respect tae the perigee  o the orbit o the muin. Thes period is associatit wi the apparent size o the full muin  , an wi the varyin duration o the synodic month  an aw. The duration o a bodie foo muin cycle is:  : 411.784 430  29   days (411 d 18 h 49 min 34 s) (at the epoch j2000.0). 
The lunar year  comprises twal foo cycles o the phases o the muin, as seen frae the Yird. It haes a duration o approximately 354.37 days. Muslims  uise thes fur celebratin thair eids  an fur markin the start o the fastin month o Ramadan   . A Musleem calender year is based oan the lunar cycle  . 
The "vague year", frae annus vagus  ("wanderin year"), is an integral approximation tae the year equalin 365 days, which wanders in relation tae mair exact years. Typically, the vague year is divided intae 12 schematic  months o 30 days each plus fife epagomenal  days. Thes "vague year" wis uised in the calendars o ancient Egypt  , Iran  , Armenia  an in mesoamerica  amang the Aztecs  an Maya  . calendar description an coordinaition  Maya Warld Studies Center. 
A heliacal year  is the interval atween the heliacal risins  o a staurn. It differs frae the sidereal year  fur stars awa frae the ecliptic  due mainly tae the precession o the equinoxes  . 
The Sothic year  is the interval atween heliacal risins o the staurn sirius  . It is presently less than the sidereal year  an its duration is huir uv a close tae the pure techt Julian year o 365.25 days. 
The Gaussian year  is the sidereal year fur a planit  o negligible mass (relatife tae the sun) an unperturbed bi ither planits at is governed bi the Gaussian gravitational constant  . Sic a planit woods be slichtly closer tae the sun than the Yird's pure techt distance. Its length is:  : 365.256 898  3   days (365 d sex h 9 min 56 s). 
The Besselian year  is a tropical year at starts when the (fictitioos) pure techt sun reaches an ecliptic longitude o 280°. Thes is currently oan or close tae Januar yin. It wis named efter the 19th century  German astronomer an mathematician Friedrich Bessel  . The followin equation  can be uised in irder tae compute the current besselian epoch (in years): [4]    : b = 1900.0 + (Julian datett − 2 415  020.313  52   ) / 365.242 198  781   the "tt" subscript  indicates at fur thes formula  , the Julian date shoods uise the terrestrial time  scale or its predecessur, ephemeris time  .

Thaur is nae universally acceptit symbol fur the year as a unit o time. The Internaitional Seestem o Units  disnae propose a bodie. Nist sp811 [9]   an ISO 80000-3:2006 [10]   suggest the symbol a   , taen frae the Laitin wird annus  . [11]   in Scots, the abbreviations "y" an "yr" ur sometimes uised, specifically in geology  an paleontology  , whaur "kyr, myr, byr" (thoosands, millions, an even billions o years, respectively) an similar abbreviations ur uised tae denote intervals o time remote frae the present. [12]   
Nist sp811 [13]   an ISO 80000-3:2006 [14]   suggest the symbol a  (in the Internaitional Seestem o Units  , althoogh a  is the symbol an aw fur the are   , the unit o area uised tae measure lain area, but context is usually enaw tae disambiguate). The abbreviations y  an yr  ur uised an aw. The unified code fur units o measure  [15]   disambiguates the varyin symbologies of ISO 1000, ISO 2955 an ansi x3.50 [16]   bi usin  : ar  fur are  and:  : at  = a_t = 365.242 19   days fur the pure techt tropical year   : aj  = a_j = 365.25 days fur the pure techt Julian year  : ag  = a_g = 365.242 5   days fur the pure techt Gregorian year   : a  = yin aj year (withit further qualifier) a definition jointly adoptit bi the Internaitional Union o Pure an Applied Chemistry  (IUPAC) an the Internaitional Union o Geological Sciences  (IUGS) is tae uise annus  , wi symbol a  , fur year, defined as the length o the tropical year in the year 2000: [17]   [18]    : a  = 365.242 192  65   days = 31 556  925.445   seconds the notation haes proved controversial; it conflicts wi an earlier convention amang geoscientists tae uise a  specifically fur "years ago", an y  or yr  fur a period o ane year. 
Fur the followin, thaur ur alternatife forms which elide the consecutife vowels, sic as kilannum  , megannum  , etc. 
In astronomy  , geology  , an paleontology  , the abbreviations yr  fur "years" an ya  fur "years ago" ur sometimes uised, combined wi prefixes fur "thoosand", "million", or "billion". [21]   The age o a stratigraphic unit or the time o a geologic event, as commonly determined bi numerical datin or bi reference tae a calibratit time-scale, main be expressed in years afair the present. The unit o time is the modren year as presently recognized worldwide. Recommended but nae mandatory abbreviations fur sic ages ur SI (Internaitional Seestem o Units) multipliers coopl ed wi "a" fur annum: ka, ma, an ga fur kilo-annum (103 years), mega-annum (106 years), an giga-annum (109 years), respectively. The uisin o these terms efter the age value follows the convention established in the field o carbon-14 datin  . The "present" refers tae 1950 ad, an sic qualifiers as "ago" or "befair the present" ur omittit efter the value coz measurement o the duration frae the present tae the pest is implicit in the designaition. In contraest, the duration o ane remote interval o geologic time, as a nummer o years, shoods nae be expressed bi the sam symbols. Abbreviations fur nummers o years, withit reference tae the present, ur cried informal (e.g., y  or yr  fur "years"; mah  , m.y.  , or m.yr.  fur millions o years; an sae forth, as preference dictates). Fur example, boondaries o the late cretaceoos epoch currently ur calibratit at 63 ma an 96 ma, but the interval o time representit bi thes epoch is 33 m.y.}} thay arenae SI units, uisin y  tae abbreviate Scots year  , but followin ambiguoos internaitional recommendations, uise either the standard Scots first letters as prefixes ("t", "m", an "b") or metric prefixes  ("k", "m", an "g"). These abbreviations include: 
Uisage o "mya" an "bya" is deprecatit in modren geophysics, the recommended usage til "ma" an "ga" fur dates befair present  , but "m.y." fur the duration o epochs. Thes ad hoc  distinction atween "absolute" time an time intervals is somewhat controversial amongst members o the Geological Society o America  . [23]   note at oan graphs uisin "ya" units oan the horizontal axis time flows frae reit tae left, which main seem coonter-intuitife. If the "ya" units ur oan the vertical axis, time flows frae top tae bottom which is probably easier tae kin than conventional notation. 
The " great year  ", or equinoctial cycle  , corresponds tae a complete revolution o the equinoxes aroond the ecliptic. Its length is abit 25,700 years, an cannae be determined precisely as the precession  speed is variable.
