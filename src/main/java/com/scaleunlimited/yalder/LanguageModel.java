/**
 * Encapsulation of model about a given language. This consists of
 * a list of ngrams (stored as 4-byte ints) and probabilities (floats).
 * The probability for an ngram is for it being that language, versus
 * all of the other known languages - so this has to be adjusted such
 * that the probabilities sum to 1.0 for the set of loaded languages.
 * 
 * Each ngram int is a right-flush (towards LSB) value, representing
 * packed character codes. So we can have a single character (e.g. 'a'
 * is stored as 0x00000061), or four characters (e.g. 'abcd' is stored
 * as '0x61626364'), or a single character that requires two bytes
 * (e.g. Hiragana 'a' is stored as 0x00003040), or any mix of one and
 * two byte values that fits into four bytes.
